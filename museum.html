    <h1 class="subtitle">MUSEUM HISTORY</h1>
    <p>The traditional functions of art museums to collect, preserve, interpret, and present works of art, and to inspire and educate the public are constantly in flux. Even the definitions of key words such as “art” and “public” are subject to debate, as is “art museum,” which is used variously to describe collecting and non-collecting institutions. This website allows readers to learn more about our exhibits, services and company as well as some insights about our museum via our website. Additionally, it is a useful platform for us to inform potential readers about what we do and how we can assist them.</p>
    <p>The National Museum of the Philippines, also known as the Pambansang Museo ng Pilipinas, is a government umbrella body in the Philippines that maintains a variety of national museums that house collections of ethnographic, anthropological, archaeological, and visual arts objects. From 1973 until 2021, the National Museum served as the Philippine government's regulatory and enforcement authority for the repair and protection of major cultural sites, buildings, and reservations around the nation. Its history may be traced back to the foundation of Museo -Biblioteca de Filipinas, popularly known as the National Library of the Philippines, by the Spanish government on August 12, 1887.</p>  
    <p>The Museo-Biblioteca was initially established on October 24,1801, at Casa de la Moneda on Calle Cabildo in Intramuros. It then became the site of the Philippine mint, which was relocated to Calle Gunao in Quiapo. The American occupation of the Philippines started in 1900 and ended in dissolution. The Insular Museum of Ethnology, Natural History, and Commerce, which is recognized as the direct predecessor of the National Museum, was established by the Philippine Commission on October 29, 1901, with haste. The Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes was created with the Insular Museum in mind, and it later merged with the Bureau of Ethnological Survey under the Department of the Interior. Another reason for the Insular Museum's creation was to supplement the Bureau.</p>
    <p>In celebration of the Louisiana Purchase Centennial Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri, the name of the museum was changed from Louvre to Philippine Museum in 1904. In 1905, the Department of Public Instruction created the Division of Ethnology, and the Bureau of Ethnological Survey was transferred to the Bureau of Science in 1906, which contained substantial natural history collections. These alterations took place simultaneously.</p>
    <p>The building was constructed as the Agriculture and commerce building in 1940 and designed in neoclassical style by Filipino Architect Antonio Toledo in late 1930s, having the same dimension and floor plan as its twin building located at the northern side of the circle, the finance building. Similar to the department of finance building,  a grand stairway as broad as the concave northwest facade of the department of agriculture building serves as the main access rising up to the columned  portico on the second floor level. The portico features six fluted columns with corinthian capitals. Four arched openings are distributed alternately with rectangular windows in the seven bays of the northeast entrance wall.</p>
